Subject: Phase 1 - Collister: An Optimising Compiler from Haskell to Java Bytecode

Phase 1 Project Selection Status Report

Name: Keith Collister

College: Robinson

User Identifier: kc506

Director of Studies: Prof. Alan Mycroft

Please complete 1, 2 and 3 below.

1. Please write 100 words on your current project ideas.

I'm planning to write a compiler from a subset of Haskell to Java Bytecode. Haskell's a fun language with some novel
features (e.g. non-strict computation, purity, and typeclasses) that aren't covered by the part 1B/2 modules so gives an
opportunity to research beyond the course content. Java bytecode was chosen as the target as it's cross-platform and a
bit higher-level than x86-64.
I'm also hoping to implement some optimisations: at the moment I'm looking at strictness analysis along with some
classical optimisations, depending on how tight the schedule is.

2. Please list names of potential project supervisors.
                                                                 
Dr. Timothy Jones has agreed to supervise.

3. Is there any chance that your project will involve any computing resources other than the Computing Service's MCS and
software that is already installed there, for example: your own machine, machines in College, special peripherals,
imported software packages, special hardware, network access, substantial extra disc space on the MCS. 

If so indicate below what, and what it is needed for.

Just my personal laptop, for development/testing etc.
