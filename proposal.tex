\section*{Introduction and Description of the Work}

The goal of this project is to implement an optimising compiler from a subset of the Haskell language to Java bytecode.
A variety of optimisations will be implemented to explore their effect on compilation and execution time, as well as on
the size of the output bytecode.

Haskell is a functional, pure, and non-strict language seeing increasing usage in industry and academia. Purity makes
programs much simpler to reason about: a programmer can usually tell from the type of a function exactly what it can do,
which makes it easier to avoid bugs.

Java Bytecode was chosen as the target language as it is portable and mature. While not as performant as native machine
code, bytecode output by the compiler built during this project can be interpreted on almost any platform, rather than
being restricted to eg. only machines with an x86-64 processor.


\section*{Starting Point}

I intend to use Haskell to develop the compiler, and Python or Bash for quick utility scripts - I have experience with
all of these languages.

I've preread the 2018 Optimising Compilers course\footnote{https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/1718/OptComp/} as
preparation: my schedule involves writing optimisations before the module is lectured.


\section*{Resources Required}

I'll use my personal laptop to develop this project: a ThinkPad 13 running NixOS. I'll use Git for version control, host
the code on a public repository on GitHub, and use TravisCI for automated tests. I also intend to keep a backup
repository on an MCS machine - my personal DS-Filestore allowance should be sufficient.

Should my laptop break or otherwise become unusable to complete the project, I have an older laptop running Debian 9
that I can use. It'll cost a few days to get it set up with a Haskell development environment.

I intend to use the GHC compiler\footnote{https://www.haskell.org/ghc/} with the Stack
toolchain\footnote{https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack} for development (both are available under BSD-style
licenses).


\section*{Substance and Structure of the Project}

The aim of the project is to develop an optimising compiler that can translate simple programs written in Haskell can be
compiled into Java bytecode that can be interpreted on platforms supporting the Java Runtime Environment.

As the focus of the project is on the implementation of various language features and optimisations operating on them, I
intend to use an existing library for lexing and parsing Haskell source code which can produce an AST from Haskell 98,
\monospace{haskell-src}\footnote{https://hackage.haskell.org/package/haskell-src}. This will allow for more time to be
devoted to those parts of the project which are more aligned with the aim.

Similarly, I intend to use the \monospace{hs-java} library\footnote{https://hackage.haskell.org/package/hs-java} to
handle the conversion from the logical representation of bytecode to the actual instruction sequences (the ``assembly''
part of the backend).

As Haskell is a lazy language, one of the major challenges will be to design a way to represent and perform lazy
computation. This might be achieved using "thunks", in-memory representations of pending computations. GHC uses a
directed graph to keep track of thunks: one way to reach a minimal working product sooner might be to use a simpler
approach first, then switch to a more performant representation later.

Haskell is a very feature-rich language, and those features are often highly dependent on each other: simple things
often touch many aspects of the language (for example, the simple numeric literal \haskell{5} which would have type
\mintinline{c}{int} in C instead has type \haskell{Num t => t} in Haskell, involving type classes and type constraints.
Simple operations like addition and subtraction on integers are provided by \haskell{Int}'s \haskell{Num} instance). In
the schedule below I've detailed which areas I intend to focus on for language features - the subset should hopefully be
small enough to be implementable in reasonable time, but large enough to allow for interesting programs to be written.

The project also aims to implement some optimisations, to improve the performance of the output of the compiler. These
are also detailed in the schedule below, and include a mix of classical optimisations (eg. peephole) and more exotic
ones (strictness analysis).

Tests are a vital part of any engineering project. During the work on the project, I'll write and maintain a test suite
to ensure the various components of the compiler work as expected and guard against regressions. I intend to use the
\monospace{tasty} framework\footnote{https://hackage.haskell.org/package/tasty} which provides a standard interface to
\monospace{HUnit}\footnote{https://hackage.haskell.org/package/HUnit} (for unit and regression tests) and
\monospace{QuickCheck}\footnote{https://hackage.haskell.org/package/QuickCheck} (for wonderful property-based tests) to
implement this test suite.


\section*{Success Criteria}

The primary goal of the project is to produce a compiler that can translate source code written in a subset of Haskell
into Java bytecode suitable for execution. This big-picture goal can be subdivided into distinct aspects:

\begin{itemize}
\item
{
    
    To succeed as a Haskell compiler, the result of this project should be able to reject ill-formed programs for
    syntactic or type errors (within the scope of the subset of Haskell implemented), and convert well-formed programs
    into JVM Bytecode. The output programs should also perform computation non-strictly.

}
\item
{
    
    To succeed as an optimising compiler, it should produce bytecode which executes faster and/or in less memory than
    bytecode produced by a non-optimising compiler (this can be tested by enabling/disabling optimisations within this
    compiler and comparing the relative execution speeds/memory footprint).

}
\item
{
    
    To succeed as a stable and reliable piece of software, it should have a comprehensive test suite including unit
    tests and regression tests for bugs found during development.

}
\end{itemize}


\section*{Extensions}

There are plenty of interesting extensions to the proposed work:

\begin{itemize}
\item
{

    There are many more features to Haskell than those mentioned in this proposal, ranging from syntactic sugar to
    features in their own right: infix operators, operator sections, point-free notation, user-defined datatypes, type
    instances, monads, do-notation for monads, do-notation for applicative functors, GADTs, user input/output, etc.

    It would be fun to increase the size of the implemented subset of Haskell, both in order to write more interesting
    programs and also to explore the effectiveness of existing optimisations on the new changes.

}
\item
{

    There exist many more optimisations that could be investigated: there are over 60 "big picture" optimisations listed
    on the GHC's "using optimisations"
    page\footnote{https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/master/users-guide/using-optimisation.html}.

}
\item
{

    One of the greatest attractions of pure languages is the relative ease with which they can be parallelised: any
    subexpressions can be evaluated at any time without effecting the result of the computation. GHC provides a
    concurrency extension including a number of simple language constructs and runtime environment options that allow
    for parallel computations to be expressed in a clean way. It would be extremely interesting to implement something
    similar (but sadly also very time consuming and far beyond the scope of this project).

}
\item
{

    The Haskell Prelude\footnote{https://www.haskell.org/onlinereport/standard-prelude.html} is the "standard library"
    of Haskell: as it is written in Haskell, it might be possible to compile parts of it using the compiler developed
    during this project, allowing it to be used in programs. However, this would require quite a significant level of
    support for the language in the compiler.

}
\item
{

    One potential advantage of using the JVM as a target is that it may be possible to provide an interface between Java
    code and Haskell code.

}
\end{itemize}

\section*{Schedule}

I intend to treat tests as part of a feature: when the schedule lists a certain feature as being deliverable in a slot,
that implicitly includes suitable tests for it.

\begin{itemize}
\item
{
    \textbf{15th Oct - 28th Oct}

    General project setup: creating a version-controlled repository of code with continuous integration to run tests.

    Create a simple frontend for converting a given file into an AST using the \monospace{haskell-src} package. Focusing
    on single files for the moment, as without proper support for modules, multiple source files don't make sense.

    The frontend should support various results from the backend: errors, warnings, and successful compilation.

    Implement a typechecking pass over the AST, \textit{including support for typeclasses}. This is one of the most
    uncertain duration parts of the project, because while the Hindley-Milner type system is well understood and
    frequently implemented, the extension of type classes seems less comprehensively covered, although there are still
    some strong leads\footnote{http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.53.3952\&rep=rep1\&type=pdf}.

    After this work, the frontend should be minimally functional and the compiler should be able to reject ill-formed
    source code either due to syntactic or type errors.

}
\item
{
    \textbf{29th Oct - 25th Nov}

    Create a simple (non-optimising) backend for experimenting with lazy evaluation. This should just perform a
    minimally-featured translation from the frontend's AST to executable bytecode (supporting eg. basic arithmetic and
    conditional expressions), but performing evaluation \textit{lazily}.

    For example, \haskell{1 + if true then 2 else undefined} should evaluate without touching the \haskell{undefined}
    subexpression and \haskell{1 + 2} should generate appropriate bytecode to evaluate the expression only when needed).
    
    This will probably involve creating an intermediate language in preparation for when more interesting language
    constructs are implemented. The purpose of such an IR is to simplify the lower layers of the compiler (eg. we can
    reduce \haskell{where} and \haskell{let} expressions from two distinct nodes in the frontend's AST to a single node
    in an IR tree).

    A lot of time has been allocated for this, as I expect that there'll be a lot of edge cases and tricky decisions to
    make when implementing lazy evaluation. Care needs to be taken to ensure that the resulting code really does behave
    similarly to call-by-need, and that the implementation doesn't have any major bugs that'll block later work.

}
\item
{
    \textbf{26th Nov - 2nd Dec}

    Implement user-defined functions, supporting currying, partial application, recursion, and laziness. Depending on
    how long this takes, this may be a convenient time to implement a number of smaller related features, such as:
    
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Pattern matching.
    \item \haskell{case} expressions.
    \item \haskell{let ... in ...} expressions.
    \item \haskell{... where ...} expressions.
    \item
    {

        Function definition by cases eg.:
        \begin{minted}[autogobble]{haskell}
        foo 0 = ... foo 1 = ... foo n = ...
        \end{minted}
    }
    \item
    {

        Function definition with guards eg.:
        \begin{minted}[autogobble]{haskell}
        foo n | n == 0 = ... | n == 1 = ... | otherwise = ...
        \end{minted}
    }
    \end{itemize}

    This week is the final week of term, where the lecture load is lightest and there's no pending supervision work, so
    a single week should be enough to complete the implementation of functions.

}
\item
{
    \textbf{3rd Dec - 9th Dec}

    Introduce lists: these are one of the most frequently used data structures in Haskell, and form the basis for many
    algorithms. They also give many opportunities to demonstrate that the implementation of lazy evaluation works
    correctly (eg. by careful analysis of expressions like \haskell{let l = 1:l in take 5 l}, which should give
    \haskell{[1,1,1,1,1]}).

}
\item
{
    \textbf{10th Dec - 16th Dec}

    At this point, a usable subset of Haskell should be complete and tested. The focus of the project now shifts to
    optimisations.

    The goal of this week is to implement a peephole pass to collapse sequences of instructions into more efficient
    versions. The sequences to be collapsed will need to be decided at the time, based on inspection of the bytecode
    output by the compiler, and I'll probably add more peephole rules as other transformations are implemented, to clean
    up their outputs.

}
\item
{
    \textbf{17th Dec - 30th Dec}

    Implement an optimisation pass performing common subexpression elimination. In a lazy language, where we can expect
    to see significant buildup of unevaluated computations in memory, ensuring that we don't have two large blobs of
    memory devoted to computing the same thing is likely worthwhile.

    This chunk of work is quite light for the time allocated to it, to allow for Christmas celebrations! I can also use
    any spare time here to catch up on any components that I've fallen behind on.

}
\item
{
    \textbf{31st Dec - 13th Jan}

    Implement strictness analysis, and accompanying optimisations. Strictness analysis is designed specifically for lazy
    languages, and this project is a prime opportunity to try it out: the optimisations opportunities revealed by
    strictness analysis should reduce compiled code size and memory usage, by eagerly evaluating expressions that are
    guaranteed to require evaluation during program execution.

    There are multiple approaches to this: the method given in the Optimising Compilers lecture course differs from the
    approach used by GHC, the de-facto Haskell compiler. I intend to read more about the different approaches and
    implement whichever is most manageable given time constraints.

}
\item
{
    \textbf{14th Jan - ?}

    \todo{Rest of the schedule to be decided?}

    Probably want to start on writing the dissertation a few weeks into 2nd term - the earlier the better, so I can
    still make corrections/tweaks to the compiler/tests/benchmarks etc.

    Hopefully time here for a few more select optimisations/extensions. Maybe list fusion or dead code elimination?
    Register colouring?

}
\end{itemize}
